## Project Goals
  Stunting cannot be cured, but it can be prevented. It is important to prevent stunting during the golden period, which is the first 1000 days of life, including the fetus period until the child is 2 years old. The role of the family is also very important in this phase. Families play an important role in preventing stunting at every stage of life. Starting from the fetus in the womb, babies, toddlers, teenagers, married, pregnant, and so on. This supports the government's efforts in handling stunting in Indonesia. Therefore, the goal of this project is to increase public awareness, especially among families and pregnant and lactating mothers, so that they are more aware of nutrition from an early age and can take steps to prevent stunting in order to prevent children's stunting.

## Product Definition and Features
Stunting in children can be prevented if parents take important steps in the first two years of a child's life. If the child does not get proper food and care during that special time, the effects that will be generated will be dangerous, one of which will lead to stunting.

Therefore, it is necessary to add insight related to stunting for prospective parents. which is to find out the indicators of the causes of stunting and know how big the stunting problem is in Indonesia today. The dashboard will display data related to the prevalence of stunting in Indonesia for the 2015-2018 period, as well as its distribution in each province. In addition, we also display several charts or tables that are indicators of the causes of stunting. Hence the public can also be educated about things that help in preventing stunting. Here is the chart that will be displayed on the dashboard:

> - Indonesia's position in South East Asia regarding the problem of stunting
> - The number of stunting prevalence in Indonesia is calculated from 2015-2018
> - Stunting trend in Indonesia by year
> - Distribution of Stunting in Indonesia (with geo chart)
> - Prevalence of stunting of children under 2 years and children under 5 years
> - Table of data each province with complete basic immunization
> - Comparison graph of malnutrition for ages 0-23 months and 0-59 months
> - Table of data each province with infants < 6 months who are exclusively breastfed

Insights that can be obtained through our dashboard are to see the effect between the stunting rate and the importance of nutrition for children both during pregnancy and during the baby's growth period. Through the data displayed on the dashboard, it is hoped that it can increase the level of public awareness of stunting behavior in Indonesia, as well as preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the percentage of children experiencing stunting.

## Target User
Based on the data and explanations that have been described in the previous sub-chapter, it can be concluded that the Indonesian people still donâ€™t realize the importance of preventing stunting in children. Therefore, it is necessary to make a dashboard about the data on the distribution of stunting in Indonesia, so that the public can see what is happening in Indonesia related to stunting. This dashboard is intended for parents who are still not aware of the existence of stunting in children. The occurrence of stunting is often not realized by parents. After the child is two years old, it turns out that the toddler is short. Sometimes, parents are not aware of this and assume that their child has eaten enough without paying attention to the nutritional content and intake given to the child. Parents can interact with this dashboard to find out the spread of stunting throughout Indonesia in various provinces and districts.

Not only parents, this dashboard is also for the Indonesian government. With the emergence of efforts from the Indonesian government, it is hoped that the prevention of stunting in children will be promoted more and there will be fewer children with stunting symptoms.
